# Future Leadfoot

_Drive better. Tune better. Win more._

## Leaderboards

Compete lap time vs lap time by searching by car, PI, drive train, power, etc.

Compare your laps with posted lap times and improve your lines.

## Live Data

See live data about your car as a simple HUD.

Watch specific data points on a rolling chart and answer questions like:
- Is the suspension bottoming out?
- What's the max lateral G on a skidpad?

Tach lights tuned for shifting up at the ideal speed.

## Tuning Guides and Worksheets

Test and tune all the parts and settings.

Measure stats by telemetry rather than in game simulations.

Track based tuning to check spring limits, damping and gearing.

## Data Analysis

Deeply compare laps and turns in a customizable interface.

Use saved video replays synchronized with telemetry.
